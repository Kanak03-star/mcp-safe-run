## Usage üì¶

Using **mcp-secure-launcher** is straightforward. Follow these steps to start running your MCP servers securely.

### Starting the Launcher

Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
mcp-secure-launcher start
```

This command will initiate the launcher and load your MCP server configuration.

### Adding Secrets

To add secrets, use the following command:

```bash
mcp-secure-launcher add-secret <key> <value>
```

Replace `<key>` with the name of your secret and `<value>` with the actual secret.

### Running Your MCP Server

Once your secrets are added, run your MCP server with:

```bash
mcp-secure-launcher run <server_name>
```

Replace `<server_name>` with the name of your server configuration.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Configuration Files

The launcher reads from a configuration file named `mcp-config.json`. Here‚Äôs a sample structure:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "MyServer",
      "port": 8080,
      "secrets": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure secrets using environment variables. Set the variables in your terminal before starting the launcher:

```bash
export API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
